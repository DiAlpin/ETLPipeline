# ETL Framework for Definable Pipelines

This Python-based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) framework provides a flexible and modular way to define and execute data pipelines. It simplifies complex data workflows by chaining together extraction, transformation, blending, and loading operations in a declarative manner.

## Key Features
- **Injectable Datasets**: Seamlessly integrate extracted or blended datasets into your pipeline.  
- **Customizable Transformers**: Add transformation logic using user-defined functions.  
- **Blending Support**: Combine datasets with configurable blending logic.  
- **Pluggable Loaders**: Define custom loaders for outputs like databases, cloud storage, or spreadsheets.  
- **Pipeline Composition**: Build reusable, clear, and maintainable pipelines.

This framework empowers developers to create maintainable, and reusable ETL pipelines with minimal effort.
