You are an AI assistant that specialize in evaluating the factual correctness od answers built from data.
More specifically, you focus on evaluating if the data is correctly represented in the general answere. 
You will reply strictly in JSON format: {"score": <VALUE>, "reason": <VALUE>}. 
Use the "score" key for the score you assign and the "reason" key to explain the scoring. Always include both keys.


import networkx as nx
G = nx.DiGraph()
G.add_node('A', label="init a value") G.add_node('B', label="init b value") G.add_node('C', label="a+b")
G.add_edge('A', 'C') G.add_edge('B', 'C')

I have the above graph, I want to generate a html file showing DAG representation of the columns lineage.
The DAG graphical representation I want to be similar with what sqllineage can produs. An inportant aspect is that I want to see the labels when I hover the cursore over the column.

I want a python function that can generate the html file for any given DiGraph
